# Yoast Meta Auditor Plugin

Audit every Yoast SEO field in one place—filter, sort, paginate, **export to CSV**, and (optionally) install **WP All Import** with a single click.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Unified filters** | Search, post-type checkboxes, per-page dropdown, plus “Empty Title / Description / Keyphrase” toggles—apply & save in one click. |
| **Column sorting** | Click any header (ID → Modified) to toggle ▲/▼. |
| **Color coding** | Rows turn 🟢 when **all** Yoast fields are filled (else zebra default). |
| **CSV export** | One-click download of *all* filtered rows—CRLF-safe for Excel/Sheets, text sanitized to avoid column bleed. |
| **WP All Import helper** | If the plugin is missing you get an “Install” button; if present you get “Start New Import”. |
